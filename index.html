                            Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who had always been told that she couldn't achieve her dreams. No matter how hard she tried, people always told her that she wasn't good enough, smart enough, or strong enough. She began to believe that
                            nothing was possible for her, and she felt defeated.
                            <br> One day, Lily was walking through the forest and stumbled upon a wise old sage. The sage asked her why she looked so sad, and Lily told him about her struggles. The sage listened intently and then told her that all things
                            are possible if she believes.
                            <br> Lily didn't understand how belief could change anything, but the sage explained that the power of belief was greater than anything else. If Lily believed in herself and her abilities, she could achieve anything she set
                            her mind to. <br> Lily took the sage's words to heart and decided to give it a try. She started by believing in herself and her abilities, and soon she noticed that her confidence was growing. She worked hard, and before she
                            knew it, she had accomplished things that she never thought possible.
                            <br> Lily was overjoyed and grateful to the sage for showing her the power of belief. She went on to achieve great things and inspired others to believe in themselves and their abilities as well. From that day on, Lily never
                            let anyone tell her that her dreams were impossible, because she knew that all things were possible if she believed.
